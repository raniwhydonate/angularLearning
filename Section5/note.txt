Angular gives us great tools to implement this flow. We can use property and event binding not only on HTML elements
and their native properties and events as we did thus far.
We can also use it on directives and we also did this with ngclass and  ngStyle that we use property binding.
But and that is important, we can also use it on our own components and bind
to our own custom properties and custom events. We can emit our own events.

EventEmitter is a generic type,which is indicated in TypeScript
by using this smaller than and greater than sign. And in between you simply define the type
of event data you're going to emit.

EventEmitter is an object in the angular framework
which allows you to emit your own events.
