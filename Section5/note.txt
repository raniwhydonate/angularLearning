Angular gives us great tools to implement this flow. We can use property and event binding not only on HTML elements
and their native properties and events as we did thus far.
We can also use it on directives and we also did this with ngclass and  ngStyle that we use property binding.
But and that is important, we can also use it on our own components and bind
to our own custom properties and custom events. We can emit our own events.

EventEmitter is a generic type,which is indicated in TypeScript
by using this smaller than and greater than sign. And in between you simply define the type
of event data you're going to emit.

EventEmitter is an object in the angular framework
which allows you to emit your own events.





while of course these CSS files have the goal of encapsulating styles for the component they belong to,
this, again, is not a default behavior, Angular gives us this behavior.




you can override this encapsulation though.
back to the server element component
you can add something to the ad component decorator.
It's called encapsulation this property.


  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None

we don't see these strange attributes being added to our elements.
this component doesn't use ViewEncapsulation

The other components still will use it there. You still see these attributes but if you now
define any styles for this component in these CSS file of this component they will actually get applied globally.


This is called "ShadowDom" instead of "Native" now - the functionality is the same though.

remove the two-way binding.
There and the other option we would have is to place a local reference on that element.
A local reference can be placed on any HTML element,



Everything you place between the opening and closing tag of your own component is lost by default.
It's simply removed from the dom.

<ng-content>
A special directive you can add in these server element components template.
it still is a directive just using

this element like selector, and this serves as a hook you can place in your component
to mark the place for Angular where it should add any content it finds
between the opening and closing tag here.

it's more complex HTML code property binding really is not the best solution
because Angular will escape HTML texts there to prevent cross sites scripting attacks from happening.



NgOnInit is a lifecycle hook




lifecycle
------------
ngOnChanges - Called after a bound input property changes    
ngOnInit - Called once the component is initialized
ngDoCheck - Called during every change detection run
ngAfterContentInit - Called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view
ngAfterContentChecked - called every time the projected content has been checked 
ngAfterViewInit - Called after the component's view (and child views) has been checked
ngAfterViewChecked - called every time the view (and child views) have been checked
ngOnDestroy - called once the component is about to be destroyed.
