the difference between attribute and structural directives, and what this star means on the structural directives.

We got attribute and structural directives.

Attribute directives are called like this because they sit on elements, Just like attributes,
and structural directives basically do the same, but they also change the structure
of the DOM around this element.

If you have ngIf on a paragraph, if that condition is false, this paragraph is removed from the DOM,
so the overall view container is affected,
whereas on the attribute directive, you never destroy an element from the DOM,
you only change properties of that element, for example, the background color.

So, that is why we have attribute directives only affecting the element they sit on,
and structural directives, which also affect the whole DOM or the view container,
the area around the element which they were placed on.



Attribute Directives

Look like a normal HTML Attribute
(possibly with a databinding or event binding)

Only affect/change the element they are added to


Structural Directives

Look like a normal HTML Attribute but have a 
leading * (for desugarging)

Affect a whole area in the DOM
(elements get added/removed)




ng g d better-highlight
command to generate directive



imp 94



star indicates to Angular that this is a structural directive.




There is only property binding, event binding,

two-way binding, and string interpolation,


ng-template

is an element which itself is not rendered, but which allows us to define a template
in the end for Angular to use once it determines that this template,
some element, needs to be rendered, because this condition is true in this case.
