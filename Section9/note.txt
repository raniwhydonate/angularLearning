A Service is just a normal TypeScript class.






AppModule - Same Instance of Service is available Application-wide
AppComponent - Same Instance of Service is available for all Components(but not for other Services)
Any other Component - Same Instance of Service is available for the Component and all its child components.



A Different way of injecting Services

Instead of adding a service class to the providers[]  array in AppModule , you can set the following config in @Injectable() :

@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class MyService { ... }
This is exactly the same as:

export class MyService { ... }
and

import { MyService } from './path/to/my.service';
 
@NgModule({
    ...
    providers: [MyService]
})
export class AppModule { ... }
